This is a Project Forked from John Smilga Javascript basic projects

The intent is to practice and improve my javascript skills by building websites using concepts needed to be a successful frontend developer.

This Project is a Color Flipper

User will be able to click on a button. Once the button is clicked the background color of the website changes. Not only does the color change but the name of the color is displayed.

To start in the html page I created the title, a header and a button that will be used to change the colors.
each element that was created was given a class that will be used to target that element with css and javascript.

In javascript I am using DOM methods:
-getElementById()
-document.querySelect();

Also adding an event listner to the button which will change the background color
This was my first time using Math.random which chooses a random number from 0 to 1. In order to expand my numbers and get them above 1, I had to multiply by my colors array.
Ex:
Math.random() * colors.length;
Next
Combine Math.floor with math random to round the random number. (Math.floor always round down)
Ex:
Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length;
